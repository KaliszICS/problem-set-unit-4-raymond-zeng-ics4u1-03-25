Missing javadocs, comments do not replace them.
Don't need information about card names in Card since they can make up any name and suit they want.  Should not restrict them.
Need to check if object is null or not a Card before comparing to avoid crash.
Could use addCard method in constructor and reshuffle instead of checking for null again.
